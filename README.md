Trading Dojo was created with [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). You can also contact me [directly](mailto:dojo.trade.wf@gmail.com).

## Possible roadmap

* Better offer filtering with an ability to search for item categories. Current categories [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15K2ZRFk34HqUNRJFJ5H6Gc-axgetOagBpCXD1wYY75w/edit#gid=1971134594) (see B1 note for a summary). Mods will probably need an additional database descriptor or other architectural changes, because users suggested categories like rifle mods, syndicate mods, warframe augments, and so onâ€”but mods have to be mods still.
* An ability for a user to search their own offers. Some users have a lot of published offers, and it can be difficult to remember them all; while it's possible to use a browser for searching among pages of offers, it would be nice to have a more convenient searching feature in the application itself.
