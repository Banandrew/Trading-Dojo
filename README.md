## Requested features

Users requested a few features that are still missing:

* Better offer filtering with an ability to search for item categories. Current categories [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15K2ZRFk34HqUNRJFJ5H6Gc-axgetOagBpCXD1wYY75w/edit#gid=1971134594) (see B1 note for a summary). Mods will probably need an additional database descriptor or other architectural changes, because users suggested categories like rifle mods, syndicate mods, warframe augments, and so on—but mods have to be mods still.
* Questionable: somehow show item's lowest–median–highest price upon publishing, so that it would be possible to price accordingly.
